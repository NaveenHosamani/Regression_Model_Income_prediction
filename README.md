## Per_Capita_income_prediction_using_Linear_Regression
This project focuses on predicting per capita income using linear regression based on historical data. The main goal is to analyze the trend of per capita income over time and create a predictive model to forecast future income trends.

Per capita income is an important economic indicator that measures the average income earned per person in a given area (usually a country). Predicting per capita income can provide valuable insights into economic growth, standard of living, and income distribution.

In this project, we use linear regression, a popular machine learning technique, to model the relationship between time (years) and per capita income. By fitting a linear regression model to historical data, we aim to understand the trend in income growth and make predictions for future years.
